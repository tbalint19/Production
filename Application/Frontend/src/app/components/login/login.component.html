        <h5>The Problem</h5>
        <li>
          The bookmakers have one
          income - and one income only - the
          money they take of away from
          their players. From you.
        </li>
        <li>
          They are in controll. They create oddses,
          they make the rules - of course they make it
          so that you - the mass of players - lose.
        </li>
        <li>
          20 billion euros each year - and it is getting higher.
          That is the amount, that they take away from you - and this is the
          amount that we give back to you. <a>Read more about the market...</a>
        </li>
        <h5>Our Innovation</h5>
        <li>
          We have created a platform, where you can exclude the bookmakers
          from the market, and play against each other.
        </li>
        <li>
          Instead of the lottery-like approach of the original sport betting
          we have created a poker-like redistribution.
