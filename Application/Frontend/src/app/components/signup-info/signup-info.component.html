  <h5>The Problem</h5>
  <li>
    The bookmakers have one income - and one income only - the money they take of
    away from their players. From you.
  </li>
  <li>
    They are in controll. They create oddses, they make the rules - of course they
    make it so that you - the mass of players - lose.
  </li>
  <li>
    20 billion euros each year - and it is getting higher. That is the amount, that
    they take away from you - and this is the amount that we give back to you.

  <h5>Our Innovation</h5>
  <li>
    We have created a platform, where you can exclude the bookmakers from the market,
    and play against each other.
  </li>
  <li>
    Instead of the lottery-like approach of the original sport betting we ha we have
    created a poker-like redistribution.
